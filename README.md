Fieldbook API docs
==================

The Fieldbook API lets you read and write records in your books. Each book has its own API, based on the structure of that book.

Use cases
---------

Use the Fieldbook API to...

* **Store content or configuration for your app:** Create a Fieldbook to hold app configuration or content, in lieu of a custom admin interface. Then read it through the Fieldbook API from your production app.

* **Prototype and demo:** Use Fieldbook as a quick back end for prototyping workflows and client apps.

* **Glue together systems and processes:** Dump structured output from one program, review and revise the results by hand, then feed it into the next stage of the process.
